This repository contains five exercises done for week 6.

Exercise1 : Reads sales figures from a CSV file, extracts sales figures for two divisions, and creates a bar plot of the sales figures.

Exercise2 : Defines the parameters of a periodic signal, creates the signal using the square wave function, and plots the resulting waveform using the stem function.

Exercise3 : Defines time range and growth/decay rates, computes growing and decaying exponentials, and plots the results using the plot function.

Exercise4 : Defines the sampling interval and time vector, defines three rectangular pulses for v1, v2, and v1-v2, and creates a plot using the subplot function.

Exercise5 : Defines the ramp and step functions, concatenates them row-wise, and plots the resulting functions using the plot function.
