This repository contains two exercises done for WEEK3

Exercise 1
The first exercise calculates the area and circumference of a circle with a given radius. 
The radius value is defined as 4, and the values for area and circumference are calculated using the formulae pir^2 and 2pi*r, respectively.
The results are printed to the console using the disp function.

Exercise 2
The second exercise generates a sine wave with a frequency of 10 Hz and amplitude of 3. 
The wave is plotted using MATLAB's plot function, with a time vector defined as 0 to 0.6 seconds with a step size of 0.02 seconds.
The title of the plot is set to "Practise equation".
