Exercise 1:
A square wave with an amplitude of 1 and a frequency of 1 Hz is generated and plotted using the "square" function in MATLAB. 
The waveform is plotted using the "plot" function, with the time vector ranging from 0 to 1 second with 1000 points. 
The x-axis is labeled as "Time," y-axis as "Amplitude," and the title of the plot is "Simple Square Wave."

Exercise 2:
Both a square wave and a sinusoidal wave are generated and plotted on the same graph using the "plot" function. 
The square wave has an amplitude and frequency of 1, while the sinusoidal wave also has an amplitude and frequency of 1. 
The x-axis is labeled as "Time," y-axis as "Amplitude," and the title of the plot is "Square Wave and Sinusoidal Wave."
 A legend is included to differentiate between the two waveforms.

Exercise 3:
A simple sinusoidal wave with an angular frequency of 1 is generated and plotted using the "sin" function in MATLAB.
The waveform is plotted using the "plot" function, with the time vector ranging from 0 to 2Ï€ with 1000 points. 
The x-axis is labeled as "Time," y-axis as "Amplitude," and the title of the plot is "Simple Sinusoidal Wave."
