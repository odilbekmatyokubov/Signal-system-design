This repository contains four exercises done for week 4

Exercise 1
The first exercise prompts the user to enter a length and the corresponding units. 
The input values are stored in the variables length and units, respectively, and are then printed to the console using the fprintf function.

Exercise 2
The second exercise generates two plots of the sine and cosine functions with a range of x values from 0 to 2*pi, with 100 evenly spaced data points. 
The first plot is of the sine function and is colored red, while the second plot is of the cosine function and is colored blue. 
Both plots are labeled with the x-axis and y-axis values and are given a title.

Exercise 3
The third exercise plots the exponential and logarithmic functions on one graph, with a range of x values from 0 to 10 with a step size of 0.1. 
The exponential function is colored red and the logarithmic function is colored blue. The graph is given a title and both axes are labeled. 
A legend is also included to distinguish between the two functions.

Exercise 4
The fourth exercise calculates the value of an investment account after 10 years with a principal investment of $1000, an annual interest rate of 5%, 
and monthly deposits ranging from $0 to $500. The values for each monthly deposit are calculated using a nested for loop that calculates the interest 
and value of the account for each month, with the final value printed to the console using the fprintf function.
