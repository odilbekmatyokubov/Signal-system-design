1 exercise: generate a sine wave signal and perform the following operations on it:

Time shift
Reversal
Scaling
Each operation is performed by modifying the original signal and then plotting the modified signal. The plots can be found in the MATLAB script continuous_time_signals.m.


2 exercise: generate a discrete-time signal and perform the following operations on it:

Time shift
Scaling
Reversal
Each operation is performed by modifying the original signal and then plotting the modified signal. The plots can be found in the MATLAB script discrete_time_signals.m.
