# Signal-system-design
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments given in the Signal and System Design course at Inha University
All of my solutions are written in MATLAB. I have included comments throughout the code to explain my approach and any assumptions made.
If you have any questions or comments about my solutions, feel free to contact me via email at rolleralien20@gmail.com
